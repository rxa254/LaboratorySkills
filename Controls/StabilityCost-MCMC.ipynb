    "$$ F_{ctrl}(\\omega) = C(\\omega) \\times A(\\omega) \\times \\epsilon(\\omega)$$\n",

    "So that's useful. That is the Amplitude Spectral Density ($ASD = \\sqrt{PSD}$) of the **Force** applied to the mirror. To find out if we are saturating the actuator, we need to turn this into a time series quantity. We do this by integrating the [PSD](http://www.pmaweb.caltech.edu/Courses/ph136/yr2012/1206.1.K.pdf).\n",

That means that amplitude of the noise, at any particular frequency, will have a Gaussian probability distribution around some mean. Since this is true for each frequency bin, we can assume (or prove it, if you like that kind of thing) that the sum of a bunch of Gaussians will also be a Gaussian. Actually, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sum of many, many whatever distributions will also be a Gaussian.\n",

    "### Definition of the Cost Function\n",
    "However, its clear from the formula above that this method weights the overall RMS of the signal without regard to any frequency dependence. In the control systems world, there are then more sophisticated schemes to have different weighting, but in many cases where we analyze LTI systems it is more clear to produce a *Cost Function*, $s$, in the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some considerations when choosing how to make an 'optimal' linear feedback controller:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Minimize a frequency-weighted version of the error signal: $\\int W_{\\epsilon}(f) \\epsilon(f) df$\n",
    "1. Minimize a frequency-weighted version of the control signal: $\\int W_{ctrl}(f) u(f) df$\n",
    "1. Minimize the rate of actuator saturations (i.e. minimize the *un-weighted* control signal)\n",
    "1. Minimize the rate of sensors (ADC) saturations\n",
    "1. avoid having any poles in the right half of the complex plane\n",
    "1. Minimize the amount of gain peaking\n",
    "1. Minimize the chance of loop instability for small, expected parameter variations.\n",
    "1. Minimize the overall number of poles + zeros in the system (helps to reduce number of components in analog circuits or computation time in digital systems). It is not too helpful to shape the loop precisely for a very specific input noise spectrum unless you are sure that the spectrum will not change very much with time (true for shot noise, falso for seismic/acoustic noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "In most practical cases, it does not make sense to make the overall cost function, $s$, depend quadratically on the cost. For example, we do not really care if we can reduce the rate of actuator saturations from 1/day to 1/month. Similarly, if the interferometer range is reduced to 1 Mpc, we do not really care if the range is further reduced to 0.5 Mpc - its all bad. So, when numerically seeking to optimize a multi-dimensional function like this, we want to make sure that the optimization manifold is well behaved, with no extremely huge mountains and no extremely deep valleys. This will allow the global optimization function to search efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variation of the Parameters\n",
    "Once we're given the systems physical parameters and all of the noise inputs, the only thing we have left to design is the feedback controller, $C(s)$. We can think about this function in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C(s) = \\frac{num(s)}{den(s)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $num(s)$ and $den(s)$ are polynomials of order N. The roots of $num(s)$ are called the ***zeroes*** of the transfer function, and the roots of $den(s)$ are the ***poles***.\n",
    "(you may have seen the use of poles and residues in classes on Complex Analysis or scattering problems in Quantum Mechanics, e.g. scattering of plane waves in 1D from any kind of potential well or barrier.)\n",
    "To optimize the feedback system, we simply vary the values of the poles and zeros (or, equivalently, the coefficients of the polynomials) in the complex plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach, called the partial fraction expansion seeks to make the optimization easier by representing $C(s)$ [as a sum of fractions](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/vectorfitting/references/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Dimensional Search for optimum controller\n",
    "Normal optimization methods based on stochastic gradient descent can often fail in multi-dimensional situations. The MCMC methods used for estimating the parameters of some experimental data can be used, by they are not as efficient at finding the optimum. They do however give more information about the shape of the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can use so-called Global Methods, such as Particle Swarm, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, etc."
