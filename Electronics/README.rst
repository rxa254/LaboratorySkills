Coaxial Cables:
---------------
#. We usually use 50 Ohm coax cables as a standard.
#. For DC/Audio applications, most of our cables are RG58, and have BNC connectors.
#. For RF, we use gold-plated SMA (male) connectors.
#. For RF uses, the following considerations are important:
  #. Is the cable 50 Ohms?
  #. Does the cable have the right dimensions so that we can fit a standard SMA connector on it?
  #. what is the attenuation (dB/foot) at ~50 MHz? SHould be less than 1 dB / 50 foot, or < 0.1 dB/m.
  #. Shielding? We prefer to use double braid or foil+braid for longer runs. For shorter runs, (few meters), its good to use solder soaked coax cables (e.g. )
#. What about HV?
